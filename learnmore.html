    Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
    It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
    Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.
    
    Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
    work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
    Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

                    <p>The steps our group had taken to create this application was creating the frontend with fake data, connecting 
                        the frontend to our backend and rendering the real data, writing our own backend and connecting it to our frontend,
                        and lastly, deploying the application.

                    <p>Our group used MongoDB, which is a popular NoSQL database that is widely used for storing and manipulating large 
                        volumes of data. It is a document store database, which means that it stores data in the form of JSON-like 
                        documents with optional schemas. This allows for greater flexibility and scalability compared to traditional 
                        relational databases, which use fixed schemas and tables to store data.

                    <p>Our group used React, which had made it painless to create interactive UIs.  We were able to
                        design simple views for each state in our application, with React efficiently updating and 
                        rendering just the right components when our data changes.
